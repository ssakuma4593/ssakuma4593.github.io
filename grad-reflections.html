                    <h4>Why Public Health?</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        After spending years in healthcare technology at Firefly Health, I realized that technology alone isn't enough to fix healthcare. 
                        The challenges are systemic, requiring policy-level interventions and a deep understanding of public health principles. 
                        My MPH at Harvard is helping me bridge the gap between technology innovation and public health policy.

                    <h4>Current Focus Areas</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        My studies are concentrated on health policy, with particular interest in how technology can be leveraged to improve 
                        health outcomes at a population level. I'm exploring the intersection of digital health innovation and equitable access to care.

                    <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
                    <ul class="text-muted">
                        <li>The importance of social determinants of health in shaping health outcomes</li>
                        <li>How policy decisions ripple through healthcare systems and communities</li>
                        <li>The critical role of equity and justice in public health interventions</li>
                        <li>The complexity of balancing innovation with regulation in healthcare</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        I'm passionate about using this foundation to create meaningful change in healthcare policy, 
                        particularly around technology adoption and digital health equity. My goal is to help shape policies 
                        that make innovative healthcare solutions accessible to all communities.

                            Starting the MPH program has been both exciting and overwhelming. The transition from industry back to academia 
                            requires a different mindset, but the diversity of perspectives from my classmates - from clinicians to 
                            policy makers to researchers - creates an incredibly rich learning environment.

                            One of the biggest shifts in thinking has been moving from individual patient care (the focus at Firefly) 
                            to population health. Understanding how interventions can impact entire communities requires a completely 
                            different framework for thinking about problems and solutions.
