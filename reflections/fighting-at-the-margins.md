# Fighting at the Margins
The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) introduces work requirements for those seeking Medicaid enrollment. Medicaid since it was introduced has kept costing more and more. I've heard that Medicaid has huge fraud and waste. Specifically, that "single men living in their mom's basement playing video games all day are getting tax credits to get healthcare" and the OBBB is targeting to remove those people who should work and are not from getting tax-payer dollars for their own healthcare. I've also heard that it is common for people on Medicaid to not have consistent jobs that can provide 80 hours of work per month to quality and without the premium tax credits, paying for health coverage out of pockets becomes impossible. So which is it? I suspect it is a little of both.
