# Fighting at the Margins
The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) introduces work requirements for those seeking Medicaid enrollment. Medicaid since it was introduced has kept costing more and more. I've heard that Medicaid has huge fraud and waste. Specifically, that "single men living in their mom's basement playing video games all day are getting tax credits to get healthcare" and the OBBB is targeting to remove those people who should work and are not from getting tax-payer dollars for their own healthcare. I've also heard that it is common for people on Medicaid to not have consistent jobs that can provide 80 hours of work per month to quality and without the premium tax credits, paying for health coverage out of pockets becomes impossible. So which is it? I suspect it is a little of both. 

![KNN Classification with K=100](/img/reflections/knn-classification-k100.png)

In my Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics class at the Kennedy school, they showed this K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model. The US is vast and the people are so diverse, yet when you are making policies like Medicaid and Medicare, it is similar to drawing a line to determine who gets what. It ends up being crude. Like this dark line that separates the people the government says should get healthcare aid, let's say it's the orange, and the people they say won't get aid, let's say is blue, there are some on the "wrong" side. Some people who should get aid are not getting aid and some people who shouldn't get aid (the single men playing video games in their mom's basement) who are. I would think the reality of the misclassification is quite small compared to all of the orange dots representing people who get aid, who otherwise would not have received anything. Yet, I think the news outlets, social media, and most of the public discourse is focused on the few misclassifications. Can we do better? Sure, but creating a brand new line as the OBBB is doing with harsher new work requirements feels rash when mistake in classification means real people will suffer.  

I wonder if this is something that ML can help with. Developing a model that can predict what parameters are the best to indicate someone who needs help with healthcare coverage. But also, something tells me that it may not be a data issue, but a political one. I've found that logic can only counter logical arguments and when they are emotions based, no amount of data will help. One can hope though, right?
