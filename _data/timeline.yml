          A cloud-based platform designed to bridge the gap between healthcare data silos and actionable insights. This project explores how modern cloud infrastructure can enable secure, scalable healthcare data analytics while maintaining patient privacy and regulatory compliance.
          
          The platform demonstrates the potential for cloud technologies to democratize access to healthcare analytics, enabling smaller healthcare organizations to leverage powerful data processing capabilities without massive infrastructure investments.
          
          Key features include automated data pipeline management, HIPAA-compliant storage solutions, and intuitive dashboards for healthcare administrators to derive meaningful insights from their patient data.
