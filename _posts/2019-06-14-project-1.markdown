description: Due to office coffee not being stellar, I bought into a coffee subscription and a Kalita Wave to try pour over. However, I like to keep my desk uncluttered and between the few coffee bags and equipment, it started to creep into my working space. After a few weeks, I decided on a magnetic spice rack that fit the coffee bags perfectly, so that I can attach it to the side of my work drawer. I then found a magnetic hook to hang my Kalita wave and I know this is not a huge success in my career, but I am super proud of this solution.
