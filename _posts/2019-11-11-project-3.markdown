description: For every birthday, I started setting x number of goals with x being how old I became. One of my goals in 2019 was to run the half marathon- actually run all of it. I never liked running, but then I realized I never really gave it a try. Without being able to run a mile, I came up with a training plan and ran this half at a 9:23 pace. Not crazy fast, but this taught me that I can do anything as long as I dedicate the time.
