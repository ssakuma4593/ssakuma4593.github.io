	<h2> Honest Self Reviews </h2>
	<p> How to express how great I am without sounding like an asshole </p>
</header>
	<p> The self review is a way for you and your manager to communicate your value to the company. This is the time to determine whether you are ready for that promotion, raise, or the time for your manager to let you know that you are not performing as expected.<br>
	The outcome of your review process should not be a surprise to you. You and your manager should have kept tabs on how well you are doing and what you should be working on. If you actually have no idea, you should really discuss your progress in more detail, more often.
	Take your time. Plan it well. This is your time to <strong>market</strong> yourself.
	</p>

<h3> Self Review Checklist </h3>
	<ul> 
		<li> Make a list of goals you were supposed to work on and look at the competency levels</li>
		<li> Go through each goal and fairly assess your progress </li>
		<li> Highlight the value added in any projects or extra tasks you picked up </li>
		<li> Discuss areas of improvement and set new goals </li>
	</ul>
	
<h4> Make a list of goals </h4>
	<p> At this point, you should have had a few goals that you and your manager decided on at the beginning of the review cycle. If you're new and didn't have a set goal, then think back to your one on ones and come up with points to improve on that were mentioned. For example, a fairly common one when you're ramping up on a new team is <i>learn the business logic</i>, basically know the why behind the work you are doing and how it is important to the vision of the company. <br>
	The goals are most often in line with the competency levels. Each company should have a breakdown of the compentency at each level. You are promoted when you are performing at one level above you, so look at what is expected of you to grow at the company. These range from, having a good network of engineers, understanding business logic and being able to counter ideas, to being able to get through the criticals rotation without help. (Really depends on the company) <br>
	Pick a few points.
	</p>

<h4> Fairly assess your progress </h4>
 	<p> For each goal that was set, brainstorm what you have done. <b> Be specific </b>. Use examples. Point to specific tickets.<br>
 	Instead of:
 	<blockquote> My goal was to be better at SQL and since the last review I have a better handle on how to optimize SQL queries. </blockquote>
 	Try: <br>
 	<blockquote> My goal was to be better at SQL. I have attended all of the SQL sessions offered at work and frequently went to SQL office hours. I made an effort to pick up more SQL tickets such as (x, y, z) and reduced the runtime of the x query from 5 minutes to a consistent 10 seconds, which significantly decreases the page load time and increases customer experience for this webpage. </blockquote>
 	</p>

 <h4> Highlight value added </h4>
 	<p> It's awesome if you're a really friendly person, but how does that help the company? As the example above, make sure to tie back each of the points to the end user and how you are creating value. This is the time to mention if you did something above and beyond your goals. This is the perfect opportunity to show off something that you've done that may have gone unnoticed by your manager. <br>
 	Example: 
 	<blockquote> Since joining the team, I have made an active effort to encourage the sense of community on my team by creating a slack channel for pod outings. I make sure to include any new engineers and most months, I plan the activity and encourage all the team members to join. The closeness of the team translates to increased productivity because it reduces the barrier to ask for help. </blockquote>
 	</p>

 <h4> Discuss areas of improvement and set new goals </h4>
 	<p> No one is perfect and being critical on your areas of improvement will show your manager your ability to correctly assess yourself. With that being said, this is not the time to point out every mistake you've ever made at work and make your manager feel like you're really messing up. These should be new goals you are setting for the next review cycle. 
 	Example: 
 	<blockquote> I would like to improve the readibility of my code and reduce the time my code is in review. By next review cycle, I will work towards becoming a certified reviewer. In order to do this, I will do at least 3 code reviews per week. Exposing myself to code that other people have written and the comments they receive, will make me more conscious of the common mistakes people make. </blockquote>
 	</p>

 <h3> FAQ </h3>
 <ol>
 	<li> How long should my review be? </li>
 		<p> It shouldn't be a few sentences because you want to have a good discussion with your manager about your progress and that's really hard to do with such few words. Most self reviews are about 3-5 paragraphs long. A paragraph each for the goals you've set. It probably shouldn't be much longer than that, but managers? Any comments on that? </p>
 	<li> Wrote my review, but not sure if it accurately reflects my progress. Can I show it to someone to look over?</li>
 		<p> Yes! Ask a friend or a team mate. Anyone that you feel comfortable showing that has worked with you before. Getting a second pair of eyes will help with wording choices and if you're missing any points. </p>
 	<li> I think I should get a promotion this next review cycle, how do I show this in my review? </li>
 		<p> Look at the competency levels and highlight how your actions meet the next level. You should be performing at at least a 'meets expectations' (or the equivalent) of the next level before you will get promoted. Therefore use specific examples to demonstrate that you are performing at this next level. (Best strategy is to discuss progress with your manager throughout the year, so that a promotion is not a surprise to you or your manager) </p>
