description: In February 2022, I became a certified Notary Public in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts because why not. I found myself in situations where someone I knew would be looking for a notary, so I looked into what it took be be a notary to be able to say "Oh, I can do that" in a moment of need. The hardest part was finding a lawyer to confirm that I am a good person because I don't know any practicing lawyers in the state of MA.
