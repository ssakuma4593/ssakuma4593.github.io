alt: How She Got There - Wayfair Engineering Event
project-date: February 2019
description: As the company starts to recognize the importance of diversity in the workplace, I felt like I could use my connections from leading Women in CS at Boston University to help this initative. After discovering one of the causes being that not enough women apply, I decided to create an event to showcase strong women in Wayfair Engineering by sharing their unique stories of how the got to where they are and the cool projects their teams are working on. With a theme of recognizing and addressing imposter syndrome, the four speakers displayed the tech they built and empowered the audience to recognize their potential in their path to becoming leaders in tech.
